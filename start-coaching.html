							<h2>So you are thinking about becoming a grassroots football coach?</h2>
									<p>Excellent, we are always looking for dedicated people that can help the great game flourish here at Nidd United JFC. The rewards of coaching youth football are immense however please don't go thinking this will be a 'walk in the park' role; there is a lot of work involved with this role!</p>
								<h3>Where to start?</h3>
									<p>Every club has it's own way of doing things and Nidd United is no different. We have a Club Ethos that all members of the club, players, parents, coaches, managers, the committee...everyone, agrees to to uphold at the start of each season. For that reason, before you consider coaching at Nidd United JFC, it's vital that you read and are happy that our Club Ethos aligns with your own principles when it comes to coaching a team. If it does, then great! If not, then perhaps we're not the right fit for you. You can read our Ethos in the drop down below and if you have any questions about how we practically work it out, then please get in touch with the Club Chairman.</p>
								<details>
								<summary>Read our Club Ethos here</summary>
									<p>The Club Ethos is a set of principles that every member of Nidd United, including players, parents, and coaches, agree to promote and uphold when they join the club.</p>
									<p>These principles guide us in every decision-making moment at Nidd United. They influence how we treat our teammates, the players coaches choose to play or substitute in a match, our behaviour as supportive parents on the side-line, how the committee manages the club - these principles have an impact on every aspect of Nidd United life.</p>				</p>
							<h2>THE NIDD UNITED ETHOS</h2>
									<h3>PLAY FOOTBALL, PLAY SAFE, PLAY FOR FUN</h3>
										<p>At Nidd United, we embrace the opportunity to play football because we want to stay active in sport throughout our teenage years. Our goal is to maintain a safe, friendly, and enjoyable environment for all. While we want to be competitive, our focus is not solely on results; we also value other important lessons from the game, like learning self-discipline and dealing with disappointment. We aim to have fun with our teammates, enjoy the game, and grow both as players, coaches and individuals without excessive pressure or anxiety.</p>
									<h3>PLAY TOGETHER</h3>
										<p>We are part of our team. We are part of the club. We train hard together; we play hard together. We contribute our time and skills. Giving all players on the squad similar match time is important to us. We will strive to promote a positive team spirit and always foster a sense of togetherness.</p>
									<h3>PLAY FAIR, PLAY HONEST</h3>
										<p>We promote good behaviour and respect for others, <a href="https://www.englandfootball.com/respect" target="_blank">following the principles outlined in the FA Respect Code of Conduct</a> for Team Officials, Players, and Spectators. We treat everyone with the same respect that we expect to receive. We demonstrate integrity both on and off the field.</p>
									<h3>PLAY TO LEAVE A LEGACY</h3>
										<p>What we do today at the club affects those who will come after us. Our goal is to ensure that what we build as a club in our time leaves it in a better place for those who join it in the future.</p>
									<hr />
								<h3>FAQs about our Club Ethos</h3>
									<details>
										<summary>What do you mean by 'giving all players similar match time'?</summary>
											<p>In line with the <a href="pdfs/FA-youth-football-guide.pdf" target="_blank">FA best practice guidance on pages 6 and 16 here</a>, we subscribe to the practice that "All players play a minimum 50%" and believe "All players getting at least half the available game time is a great way to create good team spirit." However, this part of the Club Ethos must be balanced with other parts. For example, if a player never shows up to training (without reasonable reason), then they are not demonstrating the 'Play Together' part and the Coach may decide they should not get the match time they would otherwise have been given, if selected for the squad at all.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>Does the Club Ethos allow for streaming?</summary>
											<p>As a rule, we don't stream at U12s, and rarely do so in teams above that. However, if there is sufficient numbers to allow it, and if it's is desired, streaming may occur but only if it is done in a way that complies with the Club Ethos. We will not stream purely to be competitive, rather to allow each player to train and play at a level that is helpful for their development.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>Why doesn't the Club Ethos have more specific details about how to manage the players?</summary>
											<p>The Club Ethos is not about trying to micro manage a team - we believe in empowering the managers and coaches to lead their team in the best way they feel, but within the spirit of the Club Ethos. That means each team will look different, depending on the Coaches style, but each team should be clearly identifiable as Nidd United because each element of the Club Ethos should be visible within their way of operating.</p>

							<h2>Other FAQs you may have</h2>
									<h3>Do I need to have a child at the club?</h3>
										<p>No, you do not have to have a child at the club; you just need a passion for the game, be able to positively motivate children and be very organised.</p>
									<h3>I don't currently have any FA Coaching badges, can I still coach?</h3>
										<p>Yes*, however you will be assisted by another FA Licensed coach until you fulfil all criteria as set out by the FA; currently this includes being a FA Level 1 coach, Criminal Records Check (CRC), trained in Basic Football First Aid as well as a basic Safeguarding course. (The club will help you to finance these training courses).</p>
										<p>* You will need to have passed your CRC check before we can let you take part in the training sessions.</p>
									<h3>What will I need to provide?</h3>
										<p>Apart from enthusiasm, encouragement and a good sense of responsibility, not much else. The club will allocate football equipment for training and matches for you.</p>
									<h3>Will I need to take on the role of head coach / manager straight away?</h3>
										<p>No, we are happy to let you start off as an assistant coach with a current team; however we will expect you to still have a FA CRC check (which we will organise for you); the idea with this type of training is that you can grow your confidence and knowledge with a view to hopefully taking on your own team in the future, if you enjoy the experience.</p>
									<h3>Who will I be responsible to?</h3>
										<p>The Club Committee.</p>
									<h3>Who will I be responsible for?</h3>
										<p>A relevant age group team.</p>
									<h3>What else can you tell me about the role?</h3>
										<p>The club requires the minimum FA qualification of the Level 1 Certificate in Coaching Football (including first aid award and Safeguarding Children training) for all Team Coaches. The club will assist you in obtaining this award during the season if you do not already have the qualification. Other Club Officials and Team Managers are always available for any assistance or advice. A club first aid kit will be issued to all Team Managers, which can be replenished on request. Since you are working with children under the age of 18, you are required to complete an FA CRC check.</p>
									<h3>How much time will I need to give to the role?</h3>
										<p>Team activities on match day will, depending on the venue for the game, take up approximately four hours. Coaching and training sessions at the club each week take around 2 hours. Other duties associated with the tasks outlined above are spread across the week, with telephone calls etc, and will take around four hours.</p>
									<h3>What sort of tasks are involved?</h3>
										<p>Tasks will include:</p>
											<p>Weekly:</p>
												<ul style="padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;">
													<li>Team selection; </li>
													<li>Organisation of coaching/training at club once per week;</li>
