								<h3>Nidd United Under 12s – Cup Final Champions!</h1>
  								<p>It was the result we were all hoping for and after a season of ups and downs, some fantastic effort and hard work from both the players and coaches, it was the result we felt we all truly deserved!</p>
	 							<p>Despite a busy couple of weeks which saw the team having double training sessions and playing four games in nine days, not to mention an epic game against Beckwithshaw the day before which ended in a <span class="score">5–2</span> victory, the team were in great shape for the final.</p>
								<p>Playing against the impressive Wigton Moor, and a very strong wind, the first half saw Nidd concede after a long goal kick bounced over the defenders and allowed the opposition’s striker to score. Wigton Moor took control briefly before Nidd relaxed into the match and showed everyone just how far they have come as a team. Nidd staged an impressive comeback as the team’s captain Ryan assisted his brother Isaac to score the equaliser.</p>
								<p>Wigton Moor went on the offensive again but were no match for our strong defensive line of Jimmy, William and Max. The first half finished one all and there was everything still to play for.</p>
  								<p>After a half-time huddle, the formation remained the same for the second half and Nidd soon went on to demonstrate what a great team they have become. Luke and Ryan showed no mercy in midfield as our forwards started to make their presence felt. Marley and Sonny’s skilful dribbling down the flanks was a constant threat and it was this that won a corner, which resulted in some great passing and control around the edge of the box, before Luke played the ball to William who secured the second Nidd goal of the match. <span class="score">2–1</span> to Nidd!</p>
  								<p>Some great football followed as our attackers gained more freedom on the wings. Our defenders, plus our formidable goalkeeper Hector, prevented Wigton Moor from scoring any further goals. Tensions ran high waiting for the final whistle to blow and then it was all over – Nidd became the winners of the Champion’s League Runner’s Up Cup!</p>
  								<p>The team have developed so much this season, thanks to the hard work and resilience of all the players, the patient coaching of Garry and Steve, and the support of all the parents and carers. Here’s to next season – there’s no stopping us now!</p>

								<h3>Nidd United U16 Triumph: Junior B League Champions</h3>
								<p>Our U16's finished the campaign as champions of the Harrogate and District Junior B league, racking up 29 points from 12 games and scoring 42 goals! A huge achievement by the 21-strong playing squad – everyone contributed to the consistently good performances.</p>
								<p>Not losing any of the opening games, with 5 wins in the first months of the season in 2024, was a fantastic start and put the team in contention for a table-topping finish. In 2025, the team continued to build upon the momentum with a 9-game unbeaten run in both the league and main cup competition.</p>
								<p>The title was secured in the penultimate game with a victory away against the second-ranked team. Another away win followed in the last game to finish 8 points clear at the top.</p>
								<p>Wins in two main cup rounds led to the cup final, which was decided by penalties after a draw in the match and extra time. Unfortunately for Nidd, the opposition triumphed by converting all their spot kicks.</p>
								<p>A league title and cup double didn’t happen, but that hasn’t lessened the development and growth of the team this season. Their main target was promotion to the A league, and to achieve that at the first attempt by winning the league has been an enormous accomplishment. Their effort and commitment has been rewarded, and they’re looking forward to competing in the A league next season.</p>
								<p>Many thanks to the team sponsor this season for their support - <a href="https://www.nidd-transport.com/">Delamode Nidd Ltd</a></p>

								<h3>Nidd United U12s Triumph in Penalty Shootout to Advance in League Cup</h3>
								<p>Nidd United U12s kicked off their League Cup campaign with a thrilling first-round clash against Wetherby Athletic U12s on Sunday, 23rd March 2025.
								<p>Nidd took an early lead in the first half when Nidd’s No.12 (Clark) curling shot struck the far post, allowing Nidd’s No.10 (Isaac) to calmly slot away the rebound. The team’s defense and goalkeeper put in an outstanding performance, keeping Wetherby at bay for most of the match.</p>
								<p>With just 5-10 minutes remaining, Wetherby found an equaliser to set up a tense finish. Nidd almost snatched victory before the final whistle but couldn’t quite convert their chance, sending the game to penalties.</p>
								<p>In the shootout, Nidd United held their nerve and emerged victorious with a 4-2 win. The moment of the match came when Nidd’s No. 1 goalkeeper, Hector, produced a brilliant save to deny Wetherby’s fourth penalty, securing the win and sending Nidd through to the next round.</p>
								<p>Fantastic team effort and a well-deserved victory—congratulations to all the players!</p>
