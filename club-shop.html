								<h2>New Club Shop</h2>
									<p>This year, we have been forced to change our kit supplier. However, we have tried hard to source a <strong>new kit</strong> that closely matches last season’s design to ensure continuity.</p>
									<p>You only need to purchase a new <strong>Match Kit Set</strong> if you are <strong>new to the club</strong>, your team has a <strong>new sponsor</strong>, or if last season’s kit no longer fits.</p>
									<p>As a result, there are <strong>two options</strong> available in the shop:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Match Kit Sets</strong> – These are available to order now and include a <strong>Match Shirt</strong>, <strong>Match Shorts</strong>, and <strong>Socks</strong>.</li>
										<li><strong>Individual Items</strong> (Top, Shorts, Socks) – These are <strong>not yet available</strong> but will be available to purchase <strong>early next week (29th July)</strong>.</li>
									</ul>

									<h2 style="color:red;">URGENT: ORDER Timelines for Sponsored Teams</h2>
									<p style="color:red;">Due to lead times of 5 weeks, we need all sponsored teams to have their kits ordered by <strong>31 August</strong>. After you order, the committee will need to collate the orders and submit them for you as a batch order. If you do not get your order in by the 31st, an extra fee of <strong>£10</strong> will be charged to cover the cost of an individual order.</p>


									<h3>Pricing</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Match Kit Set</strong> (includes 1 Top, 1 Shorts, 1 Pair of Socks) – <strong>£42</strong><br> If your team is sponsored, you will receive a <strong>£20 refund</strong> via the club shop after the sponsorship funds have been received.</li>
										<li><strong>Individual Items</strong>:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Top</strong> – <strong>£22</strong></li>
												<li><strong>Shorts</strong> – <strong>£17</strong></li>
												<li><strong>Pair of Socks</strong> – <strong>£9</strong></li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Delivery</h3>
									<p>All items will be ordered in bulk to the club and distributed by the coaches.</p>

									<h3>Sizing Information</h3>
									<p>To ensure the best fit, please consult our sizing chart, which you can view here: <a href="#">Sizing Guide</a>.</p>

									<h3>Before You Order</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Team Name and Squad Number</strong>: You'll need to know your <strong>team name</strong> and <strong>allocated squad number</strong> to complete your purchase. If you're unsure of your squad number, please confirm with your coach before ordering.</li>
										<li><strong>Kit Size</strong>: You will also need to know the size of the kits you want to order for each player - <a href="https://www.niddunited.co.uk/pdfs/APX-sizeguide-v2.pdf">see the sizing guide here</a></li>
										<li><strong>Sponsored Kits</strong>: If your team is <strong>Match Kit Sponsored</strong>, the sponsor branding will be added to the front of your shirt. Once the sponsorship funds are received, you will also receive a <strong>refund</strong> for the cost of the shirt.</li>

		<h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>Q: We already have kit from last year, do we have to buy different kit?</h3>
    <p>A: No, you do not need to buy new kit if your current kit still fits. However, please note that this year’s kit is from a different supplier. While we’ve made every effort to match the new kit closely to the previous one, there will be some slight differences in design.</p>

    <h3>Q: Our team has a sponsored match kit, how do we order?</h3>
    <p>A: You can still order and pay through the shop as normal. Once your order is placed, you will receive a refund for the cost of one match kit top once the sponsor funds have been received.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can I purchase individual items?</h3>
    <p>A: The Match Kit Set offer includes a full kit with a shirt, shorts, and socks at a discounted price. If you don't need a full new kit, you can buy individual items. Please select the 'Match Kit Individual Items' option from the shop front.</p>

    <h3>Q: Do I need to provide a squad number when ordering?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes, you’ll need to provide your team name and allocated squad number at checkout. If you're unsure of your squad number, please confirm with your coach.</p>
