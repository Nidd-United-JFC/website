						<h2>New Club Shop</h2>
					        <p>This year, we have been forced to change our kit supplier. However, we have tried hard to source a <strong>new kit</strong> that matches last season’s design as much as possible to ensure continuity and reduce the costs of buying new kit.</p>
                            <p>You only need to purchase a new Match Kit Set if you are new to the club, your team has a new sponsor, or if last season’s kit no longer fits.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>There are <strong>two options</strong> available in the shop:</p>
                             <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                                <li><strong>Match Kit Sets</strong> – These are available to order now and include a <strong>Match Shirt</strong>, <strong>Match Shorts</strong>, and <strong>Socks</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Individual Items</strong> (Top, Shorts, Socks) – These are <strong>not yet available</strong> but will be available to purchase <strong>early next week (29th July)</strong>.</li>

                            	<p style="color:hsl(54, 100%, 50%);">Due to lead times of 5 weeks, we need all sponsored teams to have their kits ordered by <strong>31 July 2025</strong>. After you order, the committee will need to collate the orders and submit them for you as a batch order. If you do not get your order in by the 31st, an extra fee of <strong>£10</strong> will be charged to cover the cost of an individual order and <strong>we can not guarantee your kit will be ready</strong> for the start of the season.</p>

					           <h3>FAQs</h3>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: Why is the refund for a sponsored kit £20, when the full kit costs £42 and the individual shirt costs £22?</summary>							
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: The reason the refund is £20, even though the full kit is £42 and the shirt alone is £22, is due to a few factors. The individual kit items are more expensive than the bundled match kit set for the club to purchase. Additionally, we need to cover <strong>card processing fees</strong> and <strong>delivery costs</strong> when handling orders.</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;">The £20 refund represents roughly a 50/50 split of the sponsor income. We want to make sure that the shirt is effectively "free" for parents, giving them a direct benefit from the sponsorship. However, the remaining amount helps cover costs to ensure the club doesn't run out of funds and doesn't have to raise fees.</p>
							</details>	
							<details>
							<summary>Q: We already have kit from last year, do we have to buy different kit?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: No, you do not need to buy new kit if your current kit still fits. However, please note that this year’s kit is from a different supplier. While we’ve made every effort to match the new kit closely to the previous one, there will be some slight differences in design.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: Our team has a sponsored match kit, how do we order?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: You can still order and pay through the shop as normal. Once your order is placed, you will receive a refund for the cost of one match kit top once the sponsor funds have been received.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: Can I purchase individual items?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: The Match Kit Set offer includes a full kit with a shirt, shorts, and socks at a discounted price. If you don't need a full new kit, you can buy individual items. Please select the 'Match Kit Individual Items' option from the shop front.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: How do I know which size to order?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: Please refer to our sizing chart <a href="https://www.niddunited.co.uk/pdfs/APX-sizeguide-v2.pdf">here</a> to find the best fit for you.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: Do I need to provide a squad number when ordering?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: Yes, you’ll need to provide your team name and allocated squad number at checkout. If you're unsure of your squad number, please confirm with your coach.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: What if my team has a sponsor?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: If your team’s kit is Match Kit Sponsored, the sponsor’s branding will be added to your shirt. Once the sponsorship funds are received, you will receive a refund for the cost of the shirt.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
							<summary>Q: I'm a coach – how do we get spare goalie tops for our team?</summary>
								<p style="text-align:center;">A: For spare goalie tops, please refer to our <a href="https://www.niddunited.co.uk/pdfs/NUJFC-Sponsorship%20and%20kit%20policy-v1.1.pdf">Match Kit & Sponsor Policy</a> for details on how to order additional items for your team.</p>
