								<p>The Club Ethos is a set of principles that every member of Nidd United, including players, parents, and coaches, agree to promote and uphold when they join the club.</p>
								<p>These principles guide us in every decision-making moment at Nidd United. They influence how we treat our teammates, the players coaches choose to play or substitute in a match, our behaviour as supportive parents on the side-line, how the committee manages the club - these principles have an impact on every aspect of Nidd United life.</p>
							
								<h3>PLAY FOOTBALL, PLAY SAFE, PLAY FOR FUN</h3>
								<p>At Nidd United, we embrace the opportunity to play football because we want to stay active in sport throughout our teenage years. Our goal is to maintain a safe, friendly, and enjoyable environment for all. While we want to be competitive, our focus is not solely on results; we also value other important lessons from the game, like learning self-discipline and dealing with disappointment. We aim to have fun with our teammates, enjoy the game, and grow both as players, coaches and individuals without excessive pressure or anxiety.</p>
								<h3>PLAY TOGETHER</h3>
								<p>We are part of our team. We are part of the club. We train hard together; we play hard together. We contribute our time and skills. Giving all players on the squad similar match time is important to us. We will strive to promote a positive team spirit and always foster a sense of togetherness.</p>
								<h3>PLAY FAIR, PLAY HONEST</h3>
								<p>We promote good behaviour and respect for others, <a href="https://www.englandfootball.com/respect" target="_blank">following the principles outlined in the FA Respect Code of Conduct</a> for Team Officials, Players, and Spectators. We treat everyone with the same respect that we expect to receive. We demonstrate integrity both on and off the field.</p>
								<h3>PLAY TO LEAVE A LEGACY</h3>
								<p>What we do today at the club affects those who will come after us. Our goal is to ensure that what we build as a club in our time leaves it in a better place for those who join it in the future.</p>

								<h3>FAQs about our Club Ethos</h3>
	<details>
	<summary>What do you mean by 'giving all players similar match time'?</summary>
	<p>In line with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PhqUpqAI2V8vDY99FUDZ0X8mcm1HAz5" class="wplightbox">FA best practice guidance on pages 6 and 16 here</a>, we subscribe to the practice that "All players play a minimum 50%" and believe "All players getting at least half the available game time is a great way to create good team spirit." However, this part of the Club Ethos must be balanced with other parts. For example, if a player never shows up to training (without reasonable reason), then they are not demonstrating the 'Play Together' part and the Coach may decide they should not get the match time they would otherwise have been given, if selected for the squad at all.</p>

	<details>
	<summary>Does the Club Ethos allow for streaming?</summary>
	<p>As a rule, we don't stream at U12s, and rarely do so in teams above that. However, if there is sufficient numbers to allow it, and if it's is desired, streaming may occur but only if it is done in a way that complies with the Club Ethos. We will not stream purely to be competitive, rather to allow each player to train and play at a level that is helpful for their development.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Why doesn't the Club Ethos have more specific details about how to manage the players?</summary>
	<p>The Club Ethos is not about trying to micro manage a team - we believe in empowering the managers and coaches to lead their team in the best way they feel, but within the spirit of the Club Ethos. That means each team will look different, depending on the Coaches style, but each team should be clearly identifiable as Nidd United because each element of the Club Ethos should be visible within their way of operating.</p>
