      Our Club cost over £20,000 per year to run and we could not affordably function without the fantastic support and contributions from our generous sponsors. Private sponsorship is a major source of funding, and we achieve so much more as a Club thanks to the generosity of local businesses and individuals willing to invest in us.

	<p>While some of the sponsorship directly reduces the cost of match shirts for parents, it also provides essential funding to support the day-to-day running of the club and improve the football experience for all players.	
	</p>
	<p>Here are some examples of how your sponsorship could enable the club to continue to provide a great football experience for all our players and their families:
	</p>
		<p>
		<strong>£30</strong> – Covers the first aid training cost for one coach.<br>		
		<strong>£40</strong> – Covers the referee fee for one team for one match.<br>
		<strong>£100</strong> – Pays for a set of match balls for two teams for the season.<br>
		<strong>£200</strong> – Helps the club cover a player's membership and kit costs under our Player Support Fund, ensuring that where the costs of joining the club would otherwise prevent a child playing football, they can still take part.<br>
		<strong>£500</strong> – Pays for around half of the 32 weeks of 3G mid week winter training for one of our teams.<br>
		<strong>£1,000</strong> – Covers the cost of one match pitch ground hire for a year.<br>
		<strong>£1,500</strong> – Helps fund essential equipment, like half the cost of a new set of goals.
		</p>
	<p>Every sponsor helps us go further — keeping grassroots football affordable and sustainable for all families at Nidd United.</p>

		</style>
<p>At Nidd United, we’re proud of the positive and inclusive environment we foster for our players
and families. We only accept sponsorship from individuals and organisations whose <a href="https://www.niddunited.co.uk/ethos">values align
with those of the club</a>. We reserve the right to decline sponsorship offers from businesses or
brands that we feel are not appropriate for a youth sports setting or that conflict with the ethos of
grassroots football.</p>
